# Browser Support

We endeavour to ensure our sites work correctly in Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Opera. Each of these we test in the current major release, and one version previous.

Internet Explorer has many limitations and as a result, we will make sure our projects work in IE8 and above, with an acceptable level of fallback support for IE7. As an example, differences may include the absence of some aesthetic elements such as rounded corners or drop shadows on elements. IE9 and above are the only versions of Internet Explorer to fully support responsive design. IE8 and lower will display the desktop view of the project only.

All browsers have varying levels of support for advanced features such as CSS animation. Where possible, we will provide suitable fallbacks for browsers which don't support these features.

Most projects also have a reliance on JavaScript for more advanced dynamic features such as slideshows, tabbed elements and live data sorting. The few users who don't have JavaScript enabled will receive basic, reduced functionality versions of these features.

Support for iOS and Android (Mobile and Tablet) devices are: current operating system version and one version previous, using the standard built in browser. 
We will test in other third-party browser apps but their feature support may vary.
